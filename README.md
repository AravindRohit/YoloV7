Identifying and locating things inside an image or video stream are the two related
computer vision tasks of object detection and tracking. Finding one or more items in an image
or video frame and determining their existence and location is known as object detection.
Typically, algorithms that analyze visual data and find patterns indicative of objects are used to
accomplish this. Using Yolov7 we did this.
